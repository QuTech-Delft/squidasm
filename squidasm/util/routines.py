    EPR pairs are generated in a line and turned into a GHZ state by performing half of a Bell measurement.
    That is, CNOT and H are applied but only the control qubit is measured.
    If `do_corrections=False` (default) this measurement outcome is returned along with the qubit to be able to know
    what corrections might need to be applied.
    If the node is at the start or end of the line, the measurement outcome 0 is always returned since there
    is no measurement performed.
    The measurement outcome indicates if the next node in the line should flip its qubit to get the standard
    GHZ state: :math:`|0\rangle^{\otimes n} + |1\rangle^{\otimes n}`.

    On the other hand if `do_corrections=True`, then the classical sockets `down_socket` and/or `up_socket`
    will be used to communicate the outcomes and automatically perform the corrections.

    Depending on if down_epr_socket and/or up_epr_socket is specified the node,
    either takes the role of the:

    * "start", which initialises the process and creates an EPR
      with the next node using the `up_epr_socket`.
    * "middle", which receives an EPR pair on the `down_epr_socket` and then
      creates one on the `up_epr_socket`.
    * "end", which receives an EPR pair on the `down_epr_socket`.

    .. note::
        There has to be exactly one "start" and exactly one "end" but zero or more "middle".
        Both `down_epr_socket` and `up_epr_socket` cannot be `None`.
